# Task Manager

## Backend

Follow these steps to initialize your Node.js project and set up the required packages, database, models, associations, API endpoints, authentication, and validation for your Task Manager application backend.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You'll also need a text editor or IDE for code development.

### Step 2: Create a New Node.js Project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal:

   ```
   mkdir backend
   cd backend
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Install the Necessary Packages

   Install the following packages to build your Task Manager backend:

   - **Express:** A popular web framework for Node.js.
   - **Sequelize:** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for database interactions.
   - **PostgreSQL:** A PostgreSQL driver for Sequelize.
   - **Other dependencies:** These include packages for authentication, validation, and managing environment variables.

   To install these packages, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install express sequelize sequelize-cli pg pg-hstore cors bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv express-validator
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

1. **Create a PostgreSQL Database:** Begin by creating a PostgreSQL database for your project. Make sure to note down the connection details, including username, and password. You'll need these details to configure the database connection.

2. **Initialize Sequelize:** To manage your database interactions efficiently, initialize Sequelize in your project using the following command:

    ```
    npx sequelize init
    ```
3. Configure your database connection in the config/config.json file generated by Sequelize.

### Step 4: Create Database Models

Create Sequelize models for your database tables. For example, you may have models for Users, TaskLists, and Tasks. Use the npx sequelize model:generate command to generate models and migrations for each table:
```
npx sequelize model:generate --name User --attributes name:string,email:string,password:string
npx sequelize model:generate --name TaskList --attributes name:string,color:string,order:integer,userId:integer
npx sequelize model:generate --name Task --attributes name:string,dueDate:date,priority:string,order:integer,tasklistId:integer
```
This command will generate model and migration files in the models and migrations folders.

To apply all pending migrations and update your database schema, use:
```
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

### Step 5: Define Database Associations

In your model files (models/user.js, models/tasklist.js, and models/task.js), define associations between the models.
- For example, a User has many TaskLists, a TaskList belongs to a User, and a TaskList has many Tasks.

### Step 6: Create API Endpoints
Use the Express framework to define API endpoints for managing tasks, lists, and user-related functionalities.

Define routes, controllers, and middleware to handle incoming requests and responses.

### Step 7: Implement Authentication and Validation
Secure your API by implementing user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt for password hashing.

Use express-validator to validate incoming request data and ensure data integrity.

### Step 8: Testing and Documentation
Thoroughly test your API endpoints using tools like Postman, Insomnia or automated testing libraries like Jest.
